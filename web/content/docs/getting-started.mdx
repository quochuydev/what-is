# Getting Started

Get up and running with what-is in minutes.

## Try the Playground

The fastest way to experience what-is is through our [Playground](/playground):

1. Go to [example.com/playground](/playground)
2. Enter a keyword to look up
3. Get an instant AI-powered definition
4. View your recent lookups in the history

## Using the Cloud API

For programmatic access, use our Cloud API:

### 1. Get an API Key

1. Sign in at [example.com/login](/login)
2. Go to [Cloud Console → API Keys](/c/cloud/api-keys)
3. Click "Add Key" and give it a name
4. Copy your API key (you won't be able to see it again)

### 2. Make Your First Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://example.com/api/playground/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer wi_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword": "photosynthesis"}'
```

### 3. Check Your Usage

Monitor your API usage at [Cloud Console → Usage](/c/cloud/usage).
