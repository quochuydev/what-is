# API Keys

Manage your VisionPipe API keys for server-side integration.

## Creating an API Key

1. Sign in at [visionpipe.com/login](/login)
2. Navigate to [Cloud Console → API Keys](/c/cloud/api-keys)
3. Click **Add Key**
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production", "Development")
5. Click **Create Key**
6. **Copy your key immediately** - you won't be able to see it again

## Key Format

API keys use the format:

```
vp_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- `vp_live_` - Prefix identifying VisionPipe keys
- 64 hex characters - Cryptographically random identifier

## Security

### Hashed Storage

For your security, we only store a SHA-256 hash of your API key. This means:

- We cannot retrieve your key if you lose it
- Even if our database is compromised, your keys are safe
- You must copy the key when it's first displayed

### Best Practices

- **Never commit keys to git** - Use environment variables
- **Use different keys** for development and production
- **Rotate keys periodically** - Delete old keys and create new ones
- **Delete unused keys** - Reduce attack surface

## Using Your API Key

### HTTP Header (Recommended)

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env
VISIONPIPE_API_KEY=vp_live_xxxx...

# Node.js
const apiKey = process.env.VISIONPIPE_API_KEY;
```

## API Endpoints

### Create Playground Session

Generate a playground session URL that can be shared or embedded. This endpoint deducts 1 credit from your account.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://visionpipe3d.quochuy.dev/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "credits": 2,
  "playgroundUrl": "https://visionpipe3d.quochuy.dev/playground?token=eyJ...",
  "token": "eyJ...",
  "expiresIn": 86400
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `success` | Whether the session was created successfully |
| `credits` | Remaining credits after deduction |
| `playgroundUrl` | Full URL to access the playground session |
| `token` | JWT token (valid for 24 hours by default) |
| `expiresIn` | Token expiration time in seconds |

**Error Responses:**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 401 | `Missing or invalid Authorization header` | API key not provided |
| 401 | `Invalid API key format` | Key doesn't match expected format |
| 401 | `Invalid API key` | Key not found or deleted |
| 402 | `Insufficient credits` | No credits remaining |

**Example (Node.js):**

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://visionpipe3d.quochuy.dev/api/v1/sessions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.VISIONPIPE_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log('Playground URL:', data.playgroundUrl);
```

**Use Cases:**

- Generate shareable demo links for clients
- Embed playground in your own application via iframe
- Programmatically create sessions for users

## Managing Keys

### View Keys

Go to [API Keys](/c/cloud/api-keys) to see all your keys with:
- Key name
- Key prefix (first 12 characters)
- Last used date
- Created date

### Delete Keys

Click **Delete** next to any key to revoke it immediately. Deleted keys:
- Cannot be used for new requests
- Are soft-deleted for audit compliance
- Cannot be recovered

## Audit Logging

All key operations are logged for security:
- Key creation (with IP address)
- Key deletion (with IP address)
- Key usage (last used timestamp)

These logs are available for 90 days and can be requested for compliance purposes.
