# Cloud Pricing

Simple, transparent pricing for the VisionPipe Cloud API.

## How It Works

VisionPipe uses a **credit-based** system:

- **1 credit = 1 API call**
- Credits never expire
- No monthly fees or subscriptions
- Pay only for what you use

## Credit Packages

| Package | Credits | Price | Per Credit |
|---------|---------|-------|------------|
| Starter | 1 | $1 | $1.00 |
| Growth | 6 | $5 | $0.83 |
| Scale | 30 | $20 | $0.67 |

Purchase credits at [Cloud Console → Billing](/c/cloud/billing).

## Free Tier

Every new account receives **3 free credits** to get started. No credit card required.

The [Playground](/playground) is always free and unlimited.
